# Beginner Stage: Jenkins Introduction & Basic Usage

---

## 1. What is Jenkins? (And Why Use It)

Goal:
Understand what Jenkins is and why it's used in modern software development.

Key Concepts:
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate parts of the software development process.
- It’s commonly used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
- Helps teams automate code pulling, building, testing, and deploying.

Example:
Whenever you push code to GitHub, Jenkins can automatically fetch the code, run tests, and send you the results.

## 3. Jenkins Web Interface Overview

Goal:
Get familiar with Jenkins dashboard and key navigation areas.

Key Sections:
- **Dashboard**: Your list of jobs
- **Manage Jenkins**: Global config and plugin manager
- **New Item**: Create a new job
- **Build History**: View logs of past runs

---

## ✅ 4. Create Your First Job (Freestyle Project)

Goal:
Create a basic Jenkins job, connect to Git, and automate a build step.

Steps:
1. Click “**New Item**” → Name your job → Choose **Freestyle project**
2. Configure:
- **Source Code Management**: Use Git, e.g. https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
- **Build Triggers**: How the build is triggered (manually, on schedule, or on Git changes)
- **Build Steps**: Shell script or batch file Example: npm install && npm test
- **Post-build Actions**: Email, archive artifacts, etc.

Practice Suggestion:
- Create a repo with a simple script like:
```bash
echo "Hello, Jenkins!"
```
- Create a job that pulls this repo and runs it.

## 5. Plugin Management

Goal:
Learn how to extend Jenkins functionality.

How to Manage Plugins:
- Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Plugin Manager**
- You can install, update, or remove plugins.

Useful Plugins:

| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Git Plugin       | Enable Git repo support      |
| Pipeline Plugin  | Enable Pipeline jobs         |
| Email Extension  | Advanced email notifications |
| AnsiColor Plugin | Color output in console log  |

## 6. Build Notifications & Artifacts

Email Notification:
- Configure SMTP in: **Manage Jenkins** → **Configure System**
- Add email post-build actions in the job.

Archive Build Artifacts:
- Example: Save generated .zip, .jar, or .log files after build.

## 7. Practice Projects

Project 1: Hello Jenkins
- Create a Git repo with:
```bash
print("Hello, Jenkins!")
```
- Jenkins job steps:
  - Git pull
  - Shell step: python3 hello.py
  - Success = log prints "Hello, Jenkins!"
